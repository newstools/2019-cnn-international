Desmond Tutu, the first black archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to end apartheid. He played a key role in South Africa's transition from the apartheid era, including serving as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission at the direction of then-President Nelson Mandela. In his later years, he has remained active with the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation and other organizations.
